<h3 id="process">A note on agile development</h3>

<p>I have experience employing various agile methodologies. As my teams have tended to be smaller, with the same developers responsible for production code and new feature development, I lean towards a scrumban approach. This allows for the combination of elements of scrum — sprints, planning/retrospective meetings, and daily standups — with the visual boards and work-in-progress limits of kanban.</p>

<h3 id="pitch-deck">Pitch deck</h3>

<p>I delivered this presentation in December 2017 to the President of Verizon Enterprise Solutions and the Vice President of Verizon HR, pitching them on the idea of commercializing the digital learning platform my team built. I wasn't requesting funding (yet) so much as their support in exploring the possibilities. Based on this pitch, I was given contacts within the enterprise product development and adoption services (customer education) teams and started pursuing opportunities with the latter.</p>

<h3 id="pitch-deck">Content review project brief</h3>

<p>I prefer a shorter, more succinct BRD doc called a Project Brief. I write a brief when we're planning a new software feature or some other learning project. Each brief follows a similar format, including a solid description of the problem to solve, any pertinent data, user stories, and expected success measures. For this sample project, I used the <a href="https://medium.com/@solmesz/kano-model-product-design-and-startups-a-powerful-combination-61eacf1a6f30" target="_blank">Kano product prioritization</a> technique to first identify the opportunity, then wrote the brief to scope the work.</p>

<h3 id="stats">Learning analytics wireframes</h3>

<p>I like to create wireframes in tandem with project briefs. Doing so helps me think about new features holistically and identify any user stories I may have missed. This set of wireframes details just a slice of the "Stats" funtionality in our enterprise learning platform. Users see analytics personalized to their role in a specific learning program. Rather than simply displaying a dashboard of widgets, we're providing users with narrative direction that nudges them torward recommended actions.</p>
