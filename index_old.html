<p>Thanks for checking out my work! This portfolio features recent projects completed at Verizon. If you have any questions or want to discuss further, please let me know.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="far fa-hand-peace"></i></p>

<h3 class="basic">Learning Album Platform (2011-present)</h3>

<p>Verizon uses the <a href="https://edge.learningalbum.com" target="_blank">Learning Album</a> to produce digital content for blended learning programs. I created the platform with one of my peers in 2011 to accelerate the digital transformation of the Learning & Development team. I serve as the senior product manager, leading a team of 13 engineers, designers, and product owners. Under my leadership, we've scaled the platform to 250K employees and external partners around the world, saving Verizon millions of dollars in training costs.</p>

<h3 id="album"><i class="fas fa-running"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Agile Development</h3>

<p>I earned a Scrum Master certification in 2010 and have experience implementing various agile methodologies. I don't believe there's one right way to do agile development; different projects and teams may require different versions of agile to be successful. That being said, I have found that a "scrumban" approach provides a healthy balance of structure and flexibility.</p>

<h3 id="pitch-deck"><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitch Deck</h3>

<p>I delivered this presentation to the President of Verizon Enterprise Solutions and the Vice President of Verizon HR. I pitched them on the idea of commercializing the Learning Album platform (described above). Based on this pitch, I was given contacts within the enterprise product development and adoption services (customer education) teams and began pursuing opportunities with the latter.</p>

<h3 id="pitch-deck">Content review project brief</h3>

<p>I usually create shorter, more succinct BRD's called Project Briefs. I write a brief when we're planning a new software feature or some other learning project. Each brief follows a similar format, including a solid description of the problem to solve, any pertinent data, user stories, and expected success measures. For this project, I used the <a href="https://medium.com/@solmesz/kano-model-product-design-and-startups-a-powerful-combination-61eacf1a6f30" target="_blank">Kano product prioritization</a> technique to identify the opportunity, then wrote the brief to scope the work.</p>

<h3 id="stats">Learning analytics</h3>

<p>I create wireframes in tandem with project briefs. Doing so helps me think about new features holistically and identify any user stories I may have missed. This set of wireframes details just a slice of the "Stats" funtionality in our enterprise learning platform. Users see analytics personalized to their role in a specific learning program. Rather than simply displaying a dashboard of widgets, we're providing users with narrative direction that nudges them torward recommended actions.</p>
